# Backgammon
Trying to build a backgammon something <br>
OK, this is the readme but I'll use it to try manage the workflow/ideas.

# Currently doing:
Parsing email subject lines, extracting the match results DONE
Writing information to a database DONE

# Want to add:
Adding match date
Adding LeagueInfo - maybe this can come from the email address that results are sent to, when setting up league properly using nickgroll+results2024S1A@gmail.com or nickgroll+results2024S2C@gmail.com for instance
